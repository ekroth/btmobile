Steerable robot using Arduino/Android

Old project using Arduino. The robot used five servos (four wheels) and 
an ultrasonic sensor (connected to a servo). The robot was steerable using
Android (MeetAndroid) or driving automatically using the ultrasonic sensor.

Here's the code, more or less without any comments.
